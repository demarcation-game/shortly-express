#shortly-express

This is a full-stack app called Shortly. Shortly is a URL shortener service similar to Bitly. We built out an authentication system and other features that enable users to have their own private set of shortened URLs. 

In the first part, we didn't use any OAuth provider strategy. This helped us fully understand how to roll our own server-side session-based auth system using bare bones Express.js. Then we refactored to use Passport.js's Github OAuth strategy.

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
